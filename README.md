# To-do-List

https://laylaadhar879-ops.github.io/To-do-List/

A one page app that allows users to track, edit and delete their tasks.

## Current Pages

As soon as the user loads the webpage the to do list will appear and it will allow them to add as much tasks as they like, the user has the ability to check off what they have completed, delete what they don't need and edit what if they want to change anything or made a spelling mistake. All contents will still be available to the user if they refresh the page and it would appear just how they left it. 

Within this project, I compiled the code through the following files:  *index.html*, *style.css* and *script.js*

## Features

**Adding Tasks**

**Deleting Taks**
Extracting the trash icon from font Awesome and giving it a funtion to remove the list item when it is clicked.

**Editing Tasks**



**Bootstrap**
Using the bootstrap grid i was able to proprly align the content. I implimented the link in the hean and body of the html file.

**google Fonts**
I imported my chosen fonts from google fonts and inserted it into my css file.

For the H1 i chose to use 'Titan One, cursive' To make the title stand out an easy to read as that was the main contents of the page. 

For all the other text i selcted 'Rubik, sans Serif'. This again is easy to read and is a contrast of the other font used this allows the text to be visable without taking too much from the heading.

All fonts are still visible and easy to read when the theme is changed to dark mode.

**Icons**

All icons I used in the page was imported from Font Awesome and the link is embedded in the head of the html file.
